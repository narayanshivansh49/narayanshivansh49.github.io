## Eukaryotic specialized metabolism
The study of natural products and metabolism becomes particularly difficult when considering the multicellular eukaryotes. Unlike bacteria and fungi, which oftentimes cluster the genes in a metabolic pathway within their genome, such cases are rare in multicellular eukaryotes.  I am interested in bioinformatic and experimental approaches to elucidate these difficult pathways.

## Evolution of complex traits
The complexity of eukaryotic metabolic pathways can be substantial, involving complexity from the level of small molecules to the macroscopic tissues dedicated to production of small molecules, leading to the questions of how such phenomena evolved. I am interested in the evolutionary mechanisms, theory, and framework for the evolution of metabolic systems, including genes, enzymes, and specialzed cells and tissues.
